\section{Motivation}

In this report, I will present a model of computation that I call Colored Graphs.
The motivation behind it is to a more parallel and asynchronous model of computation than let's say the very sequential Turing Machine.
But also to not be restricted by a fixed topology like is the case in cellular automata.
To be able to encode "closeness" of things that belong to each other, e.g. a function and its argument, a graph is natural representation of these kinds of relationships.
Secondly, I wanted the model to be as minimal as I could make it.
It stated out with quite general graph rewriting where large parts of the graph could be added and edges added and removed.
After some simplifications, I ended up with the model that is only comprised of two simple kinds and very local rules.
